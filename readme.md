# Project 1 - Aloha Homepage

#### This is the first project for the Web Dev Program at RED Academy.

##### It is a little difficult for me because there are a lot of new thing.

##### I need to practice more on the following:

* Flex
* Padding
* Java Script
* vw and vh


##### I did the "add to cart icon".  I did the javascript for it but it seem to be too long.  I think there is the shorter way to do it.
